# HelloVapor

Sample Vapor/Heroku Project with Request calls in the Routes handler.

This was originally generated using the Vapor Toolbox and edited using Xcode.

### Heroku Notes

1. Added Heroku Procfile, as autogenerated by Vapor Toolbox.
2. Set Heroku Buildpack to: [https://github.com/vapor-community/heroku-buildpack](https://github.com/vapor-community/heroku-buildpack).
3. Added Heroku remote Git repo link.
4. Currently Heroku's Vapor Buildpack requires LinuxMain.swift to build. This can be worked around by adding the _SWIFT_BUILD_FLAGS_ Env Var.

```bash
echo "web: Run serve --env production --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port \$PORT" > Procfile
heroku config:set SWIFT_BUILD_FLAGS="--enable-test-discovery"
heroku git:remote -a hellovaporhk
```
